# gamma-cat

An open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

* Repo: https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat
* Webpage: https://gammapy.github.io/gamma-cat

This is work in progress.
Feedback and contributions welcome!

For now, we just collect TeV gamma-ray source information.
Later we might try to ingest and interconnect other catalogs.

## Terms of use

All data collected here was originally generated by others.
If you intend to use this data in a publication,
we ask that you please cite the linked sources and/or
contact the sources of the data directly.

Collecting, cleaning and maintaining this catalog has taken a lot
of time. We require that you give attribution if you're using it.

For now, while we don't have a website / paper yet that can be
cited, please use this attribution:

> Data taken from https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat,
> an open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

Otherwise, you are free to use this data as you like.

## Data

### Overview

This catalog contains data collected from the literature
(usually one or several papers per source).

In this repository, there's four major folders:

* `input` is where we collect data about sources given in papers.
  This is very heterogeneous and is the place for data entry only.
* `output` is produced with the `make_output.py` script in an
  automatic way from `input`. It's as-homogeneous and complete data
  as possible and what you should access for information lookup.
* `docs` is a webpage that displays part of the information in the
  repo (see link above). Specifially, there's a search field to find
  a given source and then from the source detail view there's links
  to the corresponding files in the `input` folder so that
  submitting corrections and additions is easy.
* `seed` contains seed catalogs of TeV source info other people have
  collected previously. It was used to originally populate `input`
  using the `import_seed.py` script (see details below).

### Seed

As a starting point, data was ingested from these sources
(see the README files there for further information):

* https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/input/hess-galactic
* https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/input/tevcat
* https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/input/tgevcat

### Procedure

Information given in papers is very heterogeneous. Sometimes position
is given in Galactic coordinates, sometimes in RA/DEC coordinates.
There's different morphology and spectral models, sometimes certain
parameters haven't been measured or at least aren't given in the publication.

The idea is that we only collect the information from the papers here
(so that checking against the paper is easy and the manually
edited files are as small as possible), and then the `make_output.py`
script generates an as-homogeneous as possible version of the catalog.

Important points to decide:

* How do we structure the input and output information?
* How do we assign source identifiers (integer, TEV J...)?
* Do we store data per-paper or per-source?
* How do we handle sources that split out into multiple sources
  with deeper observations?
* Define source classes and their semantics

## How it works

This is very much work in progress.
Feedback and contributions welcome!

* At the moment we're just using our own Python scripts,
  and YAML files (because I find them easier to read and edit than JSON),
  as well as ECSV files.
  Maybe we'll switch to use the https://astrocats.space/ machinery later.
* We use Python scripts. Only Python 3.5+ and the latest versions of
  Astropy, Gammapy, ... are supported (very few people will run the scripts,
  no point in supporting old versions here, even if it would be easy to do).
