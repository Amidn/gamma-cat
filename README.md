# gamma-cat

An open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

* Repo: https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat
* Webpage: https://gammapy.github.io/gamma-cat

For now, we just collect TeV gamma-ray source information.
Later we might try to ingest and interconnect other catalogs.

## Notes

* At the moment we're just using our own Python scripts,
  and YAML files (because I find them easier to read and edit than JSON).
  Maybe we'll switch to use the https://astrocats.space/ machinery later.
