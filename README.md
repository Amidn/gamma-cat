# gamma-cat

An open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

This project was started in August 2015 and first presented as a poster
(see [pdf](https://github.com/gammapy/adass2016-gamma-cat-poster/blob/master/adass2016-gamma-cat-poster.pdf))
at the [ADASS 2016](http://www.adass2016.inaf.it/) conference.

* Repo: https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat
* Webpage: https://gammapy.github.io/gamma-cat
* Terms of use: see [About](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/blob/master/README_ABOUT.md) page.

This repo contains a `gammacat` Python package to work with the data.
It is BSD licensed (like Astropy, Gammapy).
This license only applies to the code, it has nothing to do with the data.

This is work in progress.
Feedback and contributions welcome!

TODO: Make a gmail account and / or discourse forum for discussions
and feedback in addition to Github issues?

For now, contact: https://github.com/cdeil (see email there).

For now, we just collect TeV gamma-ray source information.
Later we might try to ingest and interconnect other catalogs
(e.g. Fermi-LAT GeV catalogs).
