# gamma-cat

An open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

* Repo: https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat
* Webpage: https://gammapy.github.io/gamma-cat

This is work in progress.
Feedback and contributions welcome!

For now, we just collect TeV gamma-ray source information.
Later we might try to ingest and interconnect other catalogs.

## Terms of use

Collecting, cleaning and maintaining this dataset has taken a lot
of time. We require that you give attribution if you're using it.

For now, while we don't have a website / paper yet that can be
cited, please use this attribution:

> Data taken from https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat,
> an open catalog of gamma-ray sources.

Otherwise, you are free to use this data as you like.


## Notes

* At the moment we're just using our own Python scripts,
  and YAML files (because I find them easier to read and edit than JSON),
  as well as ECSV files.
  Maybe we'll switch to use the https://astrocats.space/ machinery later.
* We use Python scripts. Only Python 3.5+ and the latest versions of
  Astropy, Gammapy, ... are supported (very few people will run the scripts,
  no point in supporting old versions here, even if it would be easy to do).
