Overview
--------

Gamma-Cat is organised as a `Github respository <http://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat>`__ which mainly contains of the `catalog and collection <http://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/output>`__, the raw `input data <http://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/input>`__, the sphinx code of this `webpage <http://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/webpage>`__ and a `Python package <http://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/tree/master/gammacat>`__ to work with the data.
The project is BSD licensed (like Astropy, Gammapy).
This license only applies to the code, it has nothing to do with the data.

Gamma-Cat is under development and aims to provide data taken by HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS, WHIPPLE, HEGRA, CANGAROO, HAWC, MILAGRO, CRIMEA, ARGO, CAT and DURHAM.
In the future we may try to ingest and interconnect other catalogs like e.g. the Fermi-LAT GeV catalogs.

Unfortunately, the catalog is still incomplete. 
If you want to help us, you are very welcome to look at the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/issues>`__ (requires a Github account) or feel free to contact one of the :ref:`contributors`.

For further information you can take a look on either the `Gamma-Cat poster at ADASS 2016`_ at the `ADASS 2016`_ conference or on the follow up `Gamma-Cat poster from 2017`_ with more recent information on Gamma-Cat (and gamma-sky.net).
