# TODO list for documentation

- Move hand-written HTML webpage over to docs page?
- Shorten and simplify docs a lot!
  - Use other open catalogs at astrocats as a guide
- Say that data via any communication (Email, Dropbox) and format (CSV, text) is accepted.
  If you learn and contribute the format, great, but that's not required at all.
- Integrate `input/schemas` in docs
- Add `documentation/summary` folder with auto-generated text / tables / figures
  - Text section with basic stats (version, number of sources, ...)
  - AITOFF all-sky Figure
    - Example: http://www.asdc.asi.it/tgevcat/
    - Example: https://tde.space/statistics/sky-locations/
  - Tables from current HTML website?
- Re-structure and re-write all docs pages
