# TODO

For now I'm using this TODO list instead of Github issues for
reminders, because it's just me working on the project.

## General

- Split up `README` into several files:
  - `README.md` should be a short overview
  - `README_USE.md` should be info for users
  - `README_CONTRIB.md` 

## Coding

- In `test.py` we should actually check if data files round-trip
  on read / write. At least for `output`. Would it be good
  to have this feature for `input` as well or is it irrelevant?
- Set up binder for this repo, with an IPython notebook with all
  data loaded and examples how to use the Python package
  (or even do analysis like cone search)
