# TODO

For now I'm using this TODO list instead of Github issues for
reminders, because it's just me working on the project.

- In `test.py` we should actually check if data files round-trip
  on read / write. At least for `output`. Would it be good
  to have this feature for `input` as well or is it irrelevant?
