# Call March 2, 2018

* 10 - 11 am
* "gamma-cat" on CTA ezuce, no password -> see [connection.txt](connection.txt)
* Participants: tbd

## Agenda

* FYI: we are starting to make use of gamma-cat in CTA. See slides from Feb 16, 2018 (on CTA Indico, you need a CTA account)
  [PDF](https://indico.cta-observatory.org/event/1752/contributions/15335/attachments/13017/15464/2018-02-16_CTA_GammaCat.pdf)
  On May 14 at the CTA Orsay collaboration meeting there will be a first session on CTA catalog. We could propose a short
  presentation on gamma-cat there, explain how it can be useful as a data collection to compare with for CTA catalog papers,
  and also "lessons learned" for gamma-ray catalog about content / formats from the gamma-cat experience (if we have any,
  this would need some discussion / preparation)
* Status webpage & scripts (Peter)
* Status VERITAS data (Gernot)
* Status MAGIC data (Michele)
* Christoph: HESS Galactic catalog release coming in March; new measurement for 64 HESS sources given; suggest to add those
  to gamma-cat. Uniform format -> should be easy with a script. Open questions: multi-Gauss sources?
  Which measurement to use for the gamma-cat catalog? For further information see slides 38 & 39 in the Feb 16, 2018
  presentation mentioned above.
* Fix date / time of next gamma-cat call (April? Fix date now or Doodle?)


Unfortunately I (Christoph) didn't have time for gamma-cat. Suggest to discuss these points next time,
or only briefly now:

* Detailed proposal how to add non-detected sources (see [GH 187](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/pull/187)) (tbd)
* A proposal how to add elongation / position angle info for elongated source shapes (Christoph)


## Minutes

* General comment: there is a lot of work needed on the scripts and input data / schema validation,
  and to make the data accessible. If anyone has time to help with this, please email Christoph & Peter.
