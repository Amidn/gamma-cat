# Call Jan 10, 2017

* 10 - 11 am
* "gamma-cat" on CTA ezuce, no password
* Participants: Catherine Boisson, Konstancja Satalecka, Matthias Wegen, Gernot Maier, Peter Deiml, Christoph Deil

## Agenda

* Christoph: status and plans, [2018-01-10_gamma_cat.pdf](2018-01-10_gamma_cat.pdf)
* General discussion

## Minutes

The points I remember from the discussion:

* Christoph: thinks exposing existing data & docs is key (as mentioned already on the slides)
* Gernot: thinks completeness of the data collection is key
* Catherine: suggests to add more metadata about how the measurement was made, specificically for lightcurves
* None of these points of view conflict, it's just that different people working on gamma-cat
  have different priorities what to do first, which is fine.
* We said that we should do ~ monthly telcons on gamma-cat,
  to make sure weâ€™re moving forward and stay in contact and build something good.

Action items:

* Christoph & Peter: continue work on scripts & docs, with the goal to expose existing data to users
* Christoph & Peter: continue with HESS data entry
* Gernot: continue work on adding VERITAS data, with the goal of achieving completeness in the coming months
* Catherine: make concrete suggestions which metadata info to add
* Catherine: export http://hess.obspm.fr/ data to some machine-readable format,
  so that it could be added to gamma-cat via a reformat script (see notes at [GH 19](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/issues/19))
* Konstancja & Matthias: plan to add some more MAGIC AGN light-curve data from http://vobs.magic.pic.es/fits/
  & contact Michele Doro (see [GH 7](https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat/issues/7) for adding MAGIC data)
