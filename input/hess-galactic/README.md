# hess-galactic

## What is this?

This is data that was collected from HESS publications on
Galactic TeV sources.

Mostly by people at MPIK working on the HESS Galactic plane survey.

The following people have contributed:

* Christoph Deil
* Axel Donath
* Henning Gast
* Svenja Carrigan
* anyone else?

Started in 2011, this is the final dump / migration from August 25, 2016 

## Data and scripts

Detailed morphology and spectral data is available for all sources
in the H.E.S.S. Galactic plane survey (HGPS) region (and a few outside).

The data is in `hess-galactic.csv`, which the `hess_galactic.py` script
processes into a more uniform format.

TODO: this should be used to seed the `gamma-cat` YAML files
(one per source)

Spectral points are in separate files in ECSV format.
