This folder contains lightcurves from the DESY Lightcurve Archive, see https://astro.desy.de/gamma_astronomy/magic/projects/light_curve_archive/index_eng.html.
The Python-script 'Get_FITS_from_DESY-LC-Archive.py' dumps the FITS files from the DESY-Website directly to ECSV files.
Thereby, the lightcurve format provided in this catalogue is used.
It needs 'DESYLCArchiveToECSV.py' to run.
To dump files local, use DESY-LC-Archive_to_ECSV_local.py
A documentation of the lightcurve format can be found under 'schemas'
